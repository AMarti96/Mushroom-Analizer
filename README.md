# MUSHROM  ANALIZER

This is a project for educational purposes developed for the subject "_Smart Cities 2_" in Castelldefels' University.

The purpose of this tool is trying to know if some mushroom is edible or poisonous by knowing certain characteristics or even by uploading a simple picture.

We are not responsible of someone eating poisonous mushrooms because of this tool, this tool is only to help people to identify types of mushrooms, but the final decision is not our fault.
